      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Hello! I’m a 20-year-old working student currently pursuing my studies at Pamantasan ng Cabuyao. As a third-year college student specializing in game development, I have a passion for creating immersive experiences that engage and entertain players. Gaming has always been more than just a hobby for me; it's a vital part of my life that helps me cope with daily challenges.

By day, I focus on my studies, and by night, I work at McDonald's, where I learn valuable skills in teamwork and customer service. Balancing work and school can be tough, but it fuels my ambition to become a strong and successful game developer in the future. I’m excited to continue honing my craft and contributing to the gaming industry!
